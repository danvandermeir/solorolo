This is a FOS(S) set of code and CAD files to assist in creating a single hub motor self balancing skateboard. As I said, this is provided for free. I take no responsibility for whatever may happen with these files. You are at your own risk.

That being said, riding around on this thing has been amazing and it has been a great time putting it together. Thanks for the interest. :)

I would start with the BOM and the README files within this repo.
