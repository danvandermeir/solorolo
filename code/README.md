At this time I have chosen to utilize an [Arduino Nano](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano) to pull data from the [VESC](https://github.com/vedderb/bldc) over SPI and control LED lighting. I've chosen an acceptable generic Arduino Nano clone as availability at the time of purchase seemed to be low. I cannot vouch for personal purchasing choices, so YMMV.

I am not certain if the MCU on said board can truly handle the tasks at the frequency I am hoping as even controlling WS2812B digital RGB strips at all seems to be at it's limits. Getting accurate timing from this MCU for WS2812B LED strip control is commonly cited as a difficulty for developers. Real world tests will show if I need to adjust my MCU choice and will be forced to use a custom PCB. Not that this is a particularly challenging feat, and it's not off the table if Arduino Nanos can hand this challenge. I will eventually create a custom PCB for surface mount that will handle far more of the "custom" electronics that need to be made for this project. Included will be a resistor network for the weight sensing footpads, buck PSU to 12V or 5V, constant current PSU for LED headlights, control for said headlights, control for 12V analog LED RGB(W) strips, and controlling 5V WS2812B digital RGB LED strips. When I do decide to do this most likely I will replace the ATMEGA328P with a more capable chip.
