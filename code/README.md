At this time I have chosen to utilize an Arduino Nano to pull data from the [VESC](https://github.com/vedderb/bldc) over SPI. I am not certain if the MCU on said board can truly handle the task as even controlling WS2812B at all seems to be at it's limits and getting accurate timing from said chip is commonly a difficulty for developers. I've been considering creating a custom PCB for controlling custom headlights, analog LED RGB, and digital RGB LED strips. If I do decide to do this most likely I will add the ATMEGA328P to said board and remove the added component from the BOM. That will take some time.
