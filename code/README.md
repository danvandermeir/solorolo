At this time I have chosen to utilize an [Arduino Nano](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano) to pull data from the [VESC](https://github.com/vedderb/bldc) over SPI. I've chosen an acceptable generic Arduino Nano clone as availability at the time of purchase seemed to be low. I cannot vouch for personal purchasing choices, so YMMV.

I am not certain if the MCU on said board can truly handle the task at the frequency I am hoping as even controlling WS2812B digital RGB strips at all seems to be at it's limits. Getting accurate timing from this MCU is commonly a difficulty for developers. Real world tests will show if I need to adjust my MCU choice and will be forced to use a custom PCB. Speaking of, I've been considering creating a custom PCB for surface mount resistor network for the weight sensing footpad, controlling custom headlights, controlling 12V analog LED RGB, and controlling 5V digital RGB LED strips. If I do decide to do this most likely I will add the ATMEGA328P to said board and remove Arduino component from the BOM. That will take some time.
