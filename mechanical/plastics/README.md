Creator named collections of parts files for 3D printing or PIM to be printed/made/ordered.  
  
If printing yourself absolutely consider using stronger, weather resistant, and more heat resistant plastics for this project. PETG can generally withstand higher weights, sudden shock, and is more heat resistant than most PLA. 3D printing plastics can be complex. YMMV Don't strand yourself due to a structural issue on a roll. /helicopterparent  
  
Following [original](original/) settings of footpads/electronics plate @0.1mm height, 10 perimeter layers, and 100% infill the cavities with these settings took loosely 4 and 4.5 days of continous printing. The footpads took 3.5 and 4 days. The electronics plate under a day. Perhaps consider starting your prints first with the electronics plate followed by the resistive footpad.
