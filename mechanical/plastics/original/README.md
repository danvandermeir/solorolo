These are the original STL files I created for 3D printing. An enormous amount of care and detail went into these (measure 9 times, cut 2, print 20, or something). Obligitory "please communicate/contibute" if you see valid changes you'd like to make. :)

I tried following design rules that reduce required support material for 3D printing, and incorperating all holes into the plastic where possible. Cutting metal is more difficult than reprinting for iterative design changes.

Absolutely consider using stronger, weather resistant, and more heat resistant plastics for this project. PETG can generally withstand higher weights, sudden shock, and is more heat resistant than most PLA. 3D printing plastics can be complex. YMMV Don't strand yourself due to a structural issue on a roll.

I used an Elegoo Neptune 3 Max in a "weather sealed" closed, Octoprint on a RPi4B, and around 6 1 kilogram spools of 1.75 millimeter Overture transparent PETG. All prints that I performed were printed at 100% infill with 10 top, bottom, and vertical perimeter layers. My first layer was single layer height (0.3 millimeter). The footpads were printed at 0.1 millimeter layer height with the rest being printed at 0.3 millimeter layer height.

The cavities with these settings took loosely 4 and 4.5 days of continous printing. The footpads took 3.5 and 4 days. The electronics plate under a day. Perhaps consider starting your prints first?
